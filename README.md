<!-------------------------- New Paragraph -------------------------->

## :pencil2: Case description
### :princess: User wants & needs
> I want to fill out a survey about the minor Web Design & Development, with different answering options. If I can't finish the survey in one sitting, I want to be able to continue where I left off before at a different moment.

</br>

### :memo: Requirements
Most importantly, the survey needs to be built in a progressively enhanced way.

The survey must contain (the options to fill out) the following:
- Students' information (name & number)
- For each course:
  - Name of the course
  - Teacher who taught the course
  - Weeks in which the course was followed
  - General rating from 1 tot 10
  - Question about course materials
  - Question about explanation during the course
  - Question about how good the student understands the course materials now
- A type of form validation
- The possibility to finish the survey later and pick up where the user left off

<br/>

---

<!-------------------------- New Paragraph -------------------------->

## :interrobang: What does this Web App do?

- Allow the user to fill out a survey, whether they have CSS and JS turned on or off
- Always works - even when CSS and JS are not available
- Save the user input to a database
- Show the user input on a results page ('admin')  

<br/>

## :dizzy_face: What even IS Progressive Enhancement?
Progressive enhancement is the technique that primarily focuses on content and structure. Applying progressive enhancement ensures that the website is accessible to everyone. This means that everyone can always still use the main functionalities on the website.

First of all, only HTML is shown to the user, so that only the main functionalities are available on the website. The website is now purely functional, without any other additions.

Then a layer of CSS is added, making the website way more usable and user friendly. This way the layout can become clearer and it becomes more attractive.

Finally, there is a layer of JavaScript on top. This layer ensures that the website is pleasant to use.
According to [Aarron Walter](https://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement/), this improves the user experience per layer.

<br/>

### :cake: Progressive Enhancement as a metaphor

![progressive_enhancement_cake](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57795294/110634697-8aead000-81aa-11eb-96e5-23830ad017a5.png)

You can think of progressive enhancement as a cake.  
We start with a normal, regular piece of cake. We can see this basis as the content, which consists of semantic HTML code. By using semantic code, we ensure that every user can properly access and use the content. This base is also the largest and most important piece of the cake.

Then we add a layer of icing to it. This layer improves the look and taste of the cake. We can see this addition as the CSS, which ensures that the content is displayed in a clear, pleasant way.

Finally, we add decoration to our cake. This decoration provides the best experience for the user: a REAL piece of cake. We can think of this decoration as the JavaScript.

Without the icing and decorations, the cake can still be eaten, but this addition improves the user experience. This is progressive enchancement.

<!-------------------------- New Paragraph -------------------------->

## :electric_plug: npm install progressive-enhancement
```
npm install progressive-enhancement
```  

If only it were that easy.. I'm sure many developers would love for this to be an installable package, but for now we have to actually use our own brains to figure it out.  
:brain::wrench:. It hurts.

</br>

In order to make my website progressively enhanced, I wrote my code in three layers: first comes HTML secondly you add a layer of CSS to that and lastly you enhance the experience with a layer of JavaScript.

</br>

#### HTML
I started my app by writing semantic HTML, making the website's core as user friendly as possibly can be achieved with only HTML. I tested this HTML in my four browsers. In all four of the browsers, the HTML works exactly as intended. Even the naviagtion still works, because I used anchors!

</br>

#### CSS
Next, I added my CSS. I gave each course their own 'page' to make the survey progressively disclosed and easier to fill out, because the user needs to only focus on one course at a time. The navigation for this layout is HTML & CSS only, so it doesn't need any JavaScript to work. I did this, so the user has the most optimal layout, even if they may have JavaScript turned off. Another enhancement that gets enabled once CSS does, is a progress bar being shown to the user on each page as well. I made sure to let the progress bar work without JavaScript, because I show each course on their own 'page' and without a progress bar the survey can start to feel like it's never ending.

</br>

#### JavaScript
Last but definitely not least - JavaScript. This layer is meant to really enhance the overall user experience. When JavaScript in enabled, the user input is stored in localStorage, so they can close the window and return to the survey later. Another feature that works once JavaScript is enabled, is form validation. The form validation works together with the CSS, by checking if the user has entered something inside an input field and adding the correct class to that input field once they leave that field.

## :mag: Testing

### :globe_with_meridians: Browsers
I tested my website in the following browsers:
- Desktop: Chrome & Firefox
- iOS: Safari
- Android: Chrome

</br>

### :hocho: Cutting the mustard
I draw the line at browsers that don't support JS ES6, which are basically all browser versions that were launced before 2015 (and Internet Explorer, duh). Using ```let``` and ```const``` results in more strict and clean code and allows the use of arrow functions, which makes the code much more readable.

</br>

### :computer: What did I do in my code?
Before using a CSS selector, I checked [caniuse.com](www.caniuse.com) to see if the variable I was planning on using was supported by the browsers I'm testing my website in. To make sure that all my styling and added features worked in all browsers named above, I added some fallbacks or extra lines of code.  

</br>

An example of this, is the lines of code below. I used this ```.valid``` class in my JavaScript to give correctly filled out input fields a box shadow. Safari doesn't understand the regular ```box-shadow```, so I added in the two lines of code at the bottom. First, I set the ```-webkit-appearance``` to none, to get rid of any styling to browser may add by default. Next, I put ```-webkit-``` before my original code in order to get the box-shadow to work in Safari as well.

```
.valid {
  box-shadow: -3px 3px 0px rgba(127, 205, 123, 1);
  
  /* safari styles */
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  -webkit-box-shadow: -3px 3px 0px rgba(127, 205, 123, 1);
}
```

</br>

Another example is the extra line of code that I added in order to remove the default styles that Safari gives to buttons. I added this line of code to my regular code for the buttons.

```
  /* remove default safari styles */
  -webkit-appearance: none;
```

</br>

### :crown: Accessibility
During development, I used Chrome Lighthouse to check how my Accessibility & Best Practices were looking. The only accessibility issues Lighthouse is able to find, is that I use multiple h3's in my form (as a heading for my section with three radio buttons). I'll take it!  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57795294/113069165-06dfa300-91c0-11eb-9695-61160a853ed7.png)

</br>

I also chose to give my background a gradient (with a fallback), but keep the actual form white with black text. This combination results in the highest color contrast, ensuring that it's as accessible as far as colors go.





</br>

### :zap: Layers
In order to write a progressively enhanced website, you write your code in three layers: first comes HTML, secondly you add a layer of CSS to that and lastly you enhance the experience with a layer of JavaScript.  

</br>

#### Core
By rendering my HTML server-side, I am able to save all user input to a database. This makes it a core functionality which always works.

</br>

#### HTML
My first layer consists of only HTML. Not that pretty - but completely functional!

</br>

#### CSS
My second layer is my CSS. Once CSS is enabled, each course gets their own 'page' and the progress bar is shown to the user.

</br>

</br>

#### JavaScript
My final layer is my JavaScript. Once JavaScript is enabled, user input is saved in localStorage and form validation starts to work.

</br>

**Desktop - Chrome**  
![desktop_chrome_js](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57795294/113063712-0a6e2c80-91b6-11eb-8bb9-e7df4ec18be5.gif)

<br/>

### :red_circle: Error testing
To see what would happen if someone had localStorage turned off, I did an extra test round.  

First, I made a typo in ```localStorage.setItem```, so nothing would be able to get stored. My test showed that everything else still works as normal, except for the localStorage.  
![setItem_off](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57795294/113145183-6c6a7880-922e-11eb-8cba-0e58458df864.gif)

</br>

For my second test, I made a typo in ```localStorage.getItem```, so I would be able to get my input values, but they would be stored.. I thought. My test showed otherwise! My input values didn't get stored at all, so there wasn't even anything to **get** to begin with.  
![getItem_off](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57795294/113145185-6d030f00-922e-11eb-811d-0b9a788eb0b3.gif)

<br/>

### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Error prevention
What I could've done better here, is to implement feature detection.  

</br>

One way to implement feature detection, is to use the lines of code below. This is a good option, but I persoanlly prefer the other method below.
```
if (typeof(Storage) !== "undefined") {
  // Code for localStorage
} else {
  // Sorry! No Web Storage support..
}
```

</br>

The type of feature detection shown below is the one I personally prefer, because you ```try``` your regular code and ```catch``` whatever errors may occur during the try. In the catch, I could tell the user that their answers won't be saved if they leave, because they don't have localStorage available.

```
const populateValues = () => {
    
  const inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input');

  inputs.forEach(input => {
    try {
    const item = localStorage.getItem(input.name)
    if (item) input.value = item;

    } catch {
        console.log('localStorage is not available')
    }
}
```

## :telescope: Next steps for this project
- Automatically save the user input (no button press needed)
- Save each filled out course part of the form to the database instead of just at the end
- Expand form validation so buttons 'active' once that section of the form is filled out
- Make the title of the course sticky, so it's always visible, even if the user scrolls down
- Also make the corresponding progress bar sticky, so it's always visible 
- Add a slider to replace input type number once CSS & JS are both enabled

## :pizza: Take aways for my next project

- Use feature detection to make sure all my code always works the way I intended it to
- Write more re-usable JavaScript code like I learned to do during this course 
- Implemented more progressive enhancement
